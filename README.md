# Description

Salary data is important for many businesses as it can play a significant role in distribution of their resources. For example, a high end product needs to market their goods only to people with high income. A charitable organization may be focused to invest in areas where people make less money. Likewise, it will also help businesses to determine prices of its products and forecast sales. Governments may also be interested to know the status-quo of their citizens to carry out effective economic and development plans. Since the project determines whether a person makes more than 50K or not, we are determining the dependent categorical variable. Here, we will first collect the relevant data set. Once we collect the data, we will prepare the data using pandas, numpy and visualize the data to determine the relationship between the variables. After studying the data set, we will preprocess the data using python where we will eliminate the outliers and manage missing values. Once we successfully preprocess the data, we will make use of pythonâ€™s supervised learning packages and algorithms to build our model. Once we prepare the model, we will access the model based upon its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. If the model meets our requirements, we will deploy the model to make predictions on income level of individuals.

# About Dataset

The original dataset was obtained from the 1994 U.S. Census database. The census is performed every decade within the United States. It gathers information on the population living within the country. The information captured from the census consists of data on age, gender, country of origin, marital status, housing conditions, marriage, education, employment, etc. The sneakpeak of the dataset is as follows:
